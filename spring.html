<h1 style="text-align: center;"><i> What Do I Look For In A Spring Fragrance?</i></h1> 
<p style="text-align: center;"><b>Complement the season.</b> Obviously, one of the most important things is that the fragrance complements the season. Much like we choose our clothing depending on the season, same goes for fragrance. When it comes to scents, I take my cues from nature — green, citrusy, fresh, and vegetal.
    <br><br><b style="text-align: center;">Light and transparent.</b> Spring is not the time for heavy fragrances. Sorry to recycle the clothing analogy again, but it’s the same idea. Heavier fabrics, like flannel, tweed, and cashmere, are for fall and winter and it’s the same for heavier scents. I guarantee if you wore a crazy thick and rich oud you wouldn’t feel quite right. That’s why I always look for fragrances that are light and transparent for spring — just like a nice breeze.
    <br><br><b style="text-align: center;">Unique and distinct.</b> You should always choose fragrances that speak to you. And for me, I like to use fragrance as a way to stand out even if its just in a subtle way. It’s one of the reasons I primarily stick with niche fragrances.
    <br><br style="text-align: center;">Those are the three qualities I look for in a spring fragrance. Now let’s take a look at my six current favorites for the season.

    <h2 style="text-align: center;">Le Labo Santal</h2>  
<P style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://hespokestyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/le-labo-santal-33-eau-de-parfum-280x340.jpg"></P>
<p style="text-align: center;">Le Labo’s Santal 33 is honestly so ubiquitous these days that it almost — almost — feels like a stretch to refer to it as a niche fragrance. Introduced in 2011, it quickly gained immense popularity not just as a personal fragrance but as a go-to scent for the chicest hotel lobbies. In fact, it’s a bit of a running joke between my wife and I that if you want to smell like a Soho hotel lobby, you should wear Santal 33.

    <br><br>Top notes: Iris, Violet
    <br>Heart notes: Cardamom, Amber, Papyrus
    <br>Base notes: Australian Sandalwood, Cedarwood
    <br><br>All jokes aside, there’s a reason why this fragrance continues to enjoy such massive acclaim. Frankly, it’s intoxicating. It’s certainly a sandalwood fragrance but is not nearly as sweet and cloying as other favorites in the category such as Creed’s Original Santal or Geo. F. Trumper Sandalwood, which is one of the reasons it’s so eminently wearable. If compliments are what you seek, you can’t go wrong with this one.</p>

    <br><br><h2 style="text-align: center;">Frédéric Malle Geranium Pour Monsieur</h2>
    <P style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://hespokestyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/frederic-malle-geranium-pour-monsieur-280x340.jpg"></P>
    <p style="text-align: center;">Geranium Pour Monsieur was created by Dominique Ropion for Frédéric Malle in 2009. Some of his other creations for the house include Portrait Of A Lady, Carnal Flower, and Vetiver Extraordinaire — all considered stunning achievements. And Geranium Pour Monsieur is no exception.

        <br><br>Top notes: Mint, Aniseed, Geranium
        <br>Base notes: Sandalwood, Frankincense
        <br><br>There are a couple things I definitely need to point out about this one. First, do not be misled by this fragrance’s name. Despite being named for a flowering plant and qualified as “for him,” this is not a floral fragrance. While there are hints of geranium, they are balanced perfectly with the freshness of the mint and a very slight spicy bite of the aniseed. The overall effect is fresh, light, airy, and transparent.
        
        <br><br>The second thing to point out is also related to the notes — specifically, the base notes. You might thing that the dry down would be something in the sweet/churchy realm but that never really materializes. The opening flourish pretty much stays around for the entire life of the fragrance although you’ll notice the mint dissipate the most. Geranium Pour Monsieur is an excellent daily wear spring fragrance and has been my signature scent this season.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Ralph Lauren Polo Blue</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://hespokestyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/ralph-lauren-polo-blue-280x340.jpg"></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Although I am generally a bit of a niche fragrance snob, I think there is something special about Ralph Lauren fragrances. One of the reasons I typically steer clear of most designer fragrances is because, frankly, most of them smell pretty much the same to me. One of the joys of wearing fragrance is to find something that is unique and “you.”

    <br><br>Top notes: Cantaloupe Melon Accord, Cucumber Accord, Watery Melon Accord, Bergamot Oil
    <br>Heart notes: Aquatic Accord, Clary Sage Oil, Geranium Oil, Basil Verbena Oil
    <br>Base notes: Washed Suede Accord, Patchouli Heart, Sheer Musk Accord
    <br><br>I’ll be honest and say that before I even smelled Polo Blue, I thought it was going to be like every other springlike designer fragrance out there. But — spoiler alert — it’s not. In some ways it is exactly what you’d expect out of a spring fragrance. It’s crisp, fresh, and light. But there’s some sort of special Ralph Lauren “sauce” in there that gives it a bit of zip and spice on the top and a distinctly classic feel, despite being introduced in 2002. It’s extremely long-lasting and as it dries down it develops a nice richness on the base. Wear it all day, everyday.</p>
